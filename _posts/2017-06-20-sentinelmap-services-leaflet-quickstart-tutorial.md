# SentinelMap Services Quickstart Tutorial

## HTML and LeafletJS

In this tutorial we cover the basics of setting up a web map based on the basemap by SentinelMap.eu. We will use HTML and [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). 

Leflet is a JavaScript library that visualizes the tiles provided by the SentinelMap tile server. 
How does it work? The tiles themselves are 256px by 256px images in a .jpg format. Leaflet takes in the coordinates of the point you want to visualize (the map's *center*), and the *zoom-level* required, finds the corresponding images in the tile server and puts them on the page in a seamless way. After displaying the map, leaflet allows you also to navigate it, retrieving the images at a different *zoom*, or a different position (*panning*)... well, the whole process is a tad more complicated than this, what with filling the view area, downloading tiles simultaneously to speed up the process, etc., etc....

Without further ado, let's dive in our first page!

## Setting up the page

We start by including the leaflet.js and leaflet.css from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <title>SentinelMap Quick Start</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.3/dist/leaflet.css"
        integrity="sha512-07I2e+7D8p6he1SIM+1twR5TIrhUQn9+I6yjqD53JQjFiMf8EtC93ty0/5vJTZGF8aAocvHYNEDJajGdNx1IsQ=="
        crossorigin=""/>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.3/dist/leaflet.js"
        integrity="sha512-A7vV8IFfih/D732iSSKi20u/ooOfj/AGehOKq0f4vLT1Zr2Y+RX7C+w8A1gaSasGtRUZpF/NZgzSAu4/Gc41Lg=="
        crossorigin=""></script>
```

We also set a style for our ```div```, giving it 60% of the page width, and exactly 400px of height.

```html
    <style>
    #map {
        width: 60%;
        height: 400px;
    }
    </style>

</head>
```

Next, we need to set on the page a ```div``` that will contain our map (we center it):

```html
<body>
<h1>Our first map</h1>

<center><div id="map"></div></center>
<script>
// Leaflet code goes here.
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

With just this one `<div>` we set the stage for leaflet to visualize our map.

For leaflet to operate its magic, we need to define the JavaScript which will take care of visualizing the map. We do so, inside the `<script>` tag:

```javascript
      var Url = 'https://tile.sentinelmap.eu/2016/summer/rgb/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg?key=<my-sentinelmap-key>';
	  var Attr = 'Modified <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus</a>' +
	  ' Sentinel data 2016 by ' +
	  '<a href="https://www.sentinelmap.eu">SentinelMap</a>' ;
	  var Layer = L.tileLayer(Url, {attribution: Attr});
	  var map = L.map('map', {
	  center: [48.92, 11.25],
	  zoom: 6,
	  maxZoom: 14,
	  minZoom: 5,
	  layers: [Layer],
	  });
```

If it's too much to take at once, we are going to explain it step by step:

```javascript
var Url = 'https://tile.sentinelmap.eu/2016/summer/rgb/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg?key=<my-sentinelmap-key>';
```

First we set the URL of the tiles from SentinelMap.

In this piece of code you have to substitute ```<my-sentinelmap-key>``` with your own SentinelMap Services' key. 

Follow [this walkthough](https://github.com/sentinelmap/sentinelmap-services/wiki/Dashboard-Walkthrough) to get started with the service and obtain your own key. Don't worry: the service is free up to 50,000 tiles per month. You can comfortably play around with it and get a map going for your own blog no problem!

```javascript
var Attr = 'Modified <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus</a>' +
	  ' Sentinel data 2016 by ' +
	  '<a href="https://www.sentinelmap.eu">SentinelMap</a>' ;
```

Next we set the map's attributions (this is needed as a requirement of the Creative Commons License).

```javascript
var Layer = L.tileLayer(Url, {attribution: Attr});
```

This line of code sets the base-map layer for your map. Leaflet, of course can manage adding more layers on top of it. Learn more on leaflet's [tutorials](http://leafletjs.com/examples.html), or stay tuned for more SentinelMap tutorials to come.

```javascript
var map = L.map('map', {
	  center: [48.92, 11.25],
	  zoom: 5,
	  maxZoom: 14,
	  minZoom: 5,
	  layers: [Layer],
});
```

With this we create our map. We center it around the coordinates (48.92, 11.2), and set a zoom level of 5; we also set a min and max zoom (5 and 14) to match SentinelMap.eu's own tile range (*remember*: to-date the service does not yet cover the whole globe, only part of Europe). We then add the base-map layer we created, *Layer*. Notice how *'map'* refers to the `id` of the `<div>` we previously set on the page.

Our nice result:

### Code

This is the whole code:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <title>SentinelMap Quick Start</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.3/dist/leaflet.css"
	  integrity="sha512-07I2e+7D8p6he1SIM+1twR5TIrhUQn9+I6yjqD53JQjFiMf8EtC93ty0/5vJTZGF8aAocvHYNEDJajGdNx1IsQ=="

	    crossorigin=""></script>

    <style>
     #map {
        width: 60%;
        height: 400px;
    }
    </style>
    
  </head>

  <body class="map-layout">
    <h1>Our first map with SentinelMap.eu + leafletJS</h1>
    <div id="map"></div>
	<script>
      var Url = 'https://tile.sentinelmap.eu/2016/summer/rgb/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg?key=<my-sentinelmap-key>';
	  var Attr = 'Modified <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus</a>' +
	  ' Sentinel data 2016 by ' +
	  '<a href="https://www.sentinelmap.eu">SentinelMap</a>' ;
	  var Layer = L.tileLayer(Url, {attribution: Attr});
	  var map = L.map('map', {
	  center: [48.92, 11.25],
	  zoom: 5,
	  maxZoom: 14,
	  minZoom: 5,
	  layers: [Layer],
	  });
	</script>
  </body>
</html>

```
