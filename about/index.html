<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>
The Rant Master is an old mammoth (oldmammuth) living among us...<br>

Like all mammoths, he likes to be up to no good at all time, with different interests...<br>

Up till now, he only managed to set up Jeckyll to run this show, but beware, he is always up to no good!
