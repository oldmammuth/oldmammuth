Yeah, it's supposed to be the page everyone's searching for, right?

Well, since I know this is all BS, if you are really interested in my CV, just contact me (see email in the footer).

## Why would I act so insanely as not publishing a CV???

- 1st: I'd rather keep the spread of info re. my person on check (privacy is not just a fancy, exotic word...)
- 2nd: This ensure you do have a valid reason to check out my CV, since it puts a barrier to the access; this in turn gives me enough reassurance as to trust you with my personal data (maybe...)
