<p>
Yeah, it's supposed to be the page everyone's searching for, right?<br>

Well, since I know this is all BS, if you are really interested in my CV, just contact me (see email in the footer).<br>

<h4>Why would I act so insanely as not publishing a CV???</h4>
</p>
<ul>

<li>1st: I'd rather keep the spread of info re. my person on check (privacy is not just a fancy, exotic word...)</li>

<li>2nd: This ensure you do have a valid reason to check out my CV, since it puts a barrier to the access; this in turn gives me enough reassurance as to trus you with my personal data (maybe...)</li>

</ul>
